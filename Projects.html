        <h4>Tax Research Memo for Income Tax Accounting</h4>
        <p>Our group was asked to write a tax research memo regarding a client's question about installing a pool versus buying a house with a pool already installed. 
        In some cases, a portion of the expenses incurred to install a pool can be deducted if the primary reason for the pool is medicinal. Our findings are linked in 
        the memo below.</p>
